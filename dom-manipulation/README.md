# DOM Manipulation, Web Storage, and Working with JSON Data
This is my **DOM Manipulation, Web Storage, and Working with JSON Data** project, which is part of my ALX SE Front-End Development journey.

## Project Overview
This project involves;
- Creating and manipulating dynamic content using **JavaScript**.
- Persist data across browser sessions using **Local Storage** and **Session Storage**.
- Import and export **JSON data** to manage application state.
- Implement a **dynamic content filtering system**.
- Synch local data with a server and handle potential conflicts.
